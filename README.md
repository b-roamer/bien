# Bien
### The Ultimate Archive of Formula-1 Races 



#### Description
*Bien* is the online archive of all Formula-1 races gathered in one place. 
Since the history of Formula-1 dates back to times way before web applications were even heard of, it is essential to digitilize the existing data in order to keep track of the history and help people learn about this beautiful and legendary sport.

#### Project Scope
MVP is planned to be finished within a couple of months. After thorough testing and final production corrections *Bien* is projected to be fully operable by the end of March/April.

#### Technologies used in the project 
*Bien* is a web application built using the following stack:
* Frontend - NuxtJS (VueJS Framework)
* Backend - ASP.NET 5 (C#)
* Database - MySQL

NuxtJS is a framework for VueJS, a component based JavaScript framework, that allows server-side rendering.

ASP.NET 5 is a C# framework for building extremely fast and secure web applications.

MySQL is a simple SQL database that is perfectly compatible with C#.
